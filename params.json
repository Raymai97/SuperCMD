Why do this?\r\nSince Windows Vista, if you want to modify system files, such as explorer.exe, having just Administrator is not enough; you need to override the NTFS permission such as changing file owner and permission.\r\n\r\nThe problem with that is, most people forget or have no idea how to restore back the NTFS permission after they're done. The worse is, some of them don't even know what they're doing, they just simply click on the \"Grant all permission\", thinking that would resolve anything that comes into their way.\r\n\r\nThis would render NTFS and UAC useless.\r\n\r\nBut restoring NTFS permission is so tedious, so what is the alternative?\r\n\r\n### Let's be the TrustedInstaller\r\nEven wonder how Windows Update updates system files without hassle? The answer is, TrustedInstaller. TrustedInstaller, also known as Windows Modules Installer, is a Windows service that has the power to update system files. It can access anything on the system partition, because it is running on SYSTEM user which has the highest privileges.\r\n\r\nSuperCMD allows you to run your program as SYSTEM with TrustedInstaller token. Yes, your program will be as powerful as TrustedInstaller is, capable to modify whatever TrustedInstaller can, without changing anything related to NTFS permission.\r\n\r\n### SuperCMD features\r\n* Only one EXE and some XMLs, no DLLs, small and neat\r\n* Command line support\r\n* DPI scaling support\r\n* MUI support (English, 简体中文, 繁體中文, 日本語)\r\n* Context menu integration support\r\n* Quick Launch, allows you to set your favorite tools to run with SuperCMD\r\n* Can create shortcut to run your program with SuperCMD\r\n\r\n... and this program has Win3.1 style buttons as well, I like the button of Win3.1 a lot ^^.\r\nOf course, it can be disabled. :p\r\n\r\nNow it is the time for you to make your move.\r\nLet SuperCMD be a part of your life! No more \"changing NTFS permission\"!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
